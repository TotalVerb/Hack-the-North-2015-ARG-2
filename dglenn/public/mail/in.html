Kate,

I am so sorry for the delayed response. I have gotten many emails similar to
yours recently. The hack is not limited to your box; indeed, I have reason to
believe that even the CEO's files are not safe.

After an initial investigation I suspect that the following vulnerabilities were
used:
* a code injection vulnerability on the public node
* race conditions on our bank terminal
* a single employee gaining access to leak all secrets

With that in mind, there are several important points about our situation that
I would like to discuss... with <em>all</em> our employees.

Firstly, all our directors (8 of them) have been instructed to secure their keys
in a company vault. Because we are a bank, we are able to provide impressive
physical security to our keys. I do not know why I had not thought of this
before... indeed I suspect that it was the poor storage locations of these keys
that led to the theft of our CEO's files.

Secondly, as you are aware, our new website has been decommissioned. Don has
done a great job with the old website, which has not been compromised as far as
I know. Don and I are currently working on reimplementing all the functionality
of the new site back on our old website.

Cheers,
Wesley F. Scott
CSO (Chief Security Officer)
The North Bank
