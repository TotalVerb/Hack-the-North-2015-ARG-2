My good friend, your first task is simple:

Decrypt the grid. 

Once that is all done, the below is of utmost importance.

The information below may be of some use to you.
You're given that Z = (1,1) and Q = (26,1)

Absolute origin is (x,y) = (8,15)
Basis of key: [(3,1),(-2,1)]
Note that (14,8) is actually (0,0) relative to the basis.

Coordinates below are given in the basis of [(1,0), (0,1)]

(2,1),(2,3),(4,6),(0,-2),(0,-1),(5,7),(4,8),(5,2),(2,-3)

This will be your way out my good friend.
